# Full Screen Header

Simplest possible way to have a full screen header that responds to browser resizing.  All page content is contained below the height of the screen.

## TODO
- Move current scroll callback out of plugin
- Remove dependencies on ID'd elements
- Simplify HTML / CSS if possible
- Remove Bootstrap
